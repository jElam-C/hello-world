# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
Hello, I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in computer science with an emphesis on game design/development and this is my first time really sitting down to learn about git and how to use it.
I learned about version control systems while getting my degree, but I've only used Unity version control in the Unity cloud during a small group game project for a class.
As far as coding languages go, I am familiar with C++ and C# and I've used Unity to make a functional 3D game prototype that was reviewed by a faculty panel at the University. 
I'm excited to start using Git and learning more about version control systems so I can collaborate more effectively with others! :)
